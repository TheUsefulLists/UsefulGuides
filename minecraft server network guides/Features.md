# Features

What are features? Features are things that make your server unique. They are things that make your server stand out from the rest.

Why should you have features? Having features will make your server stand out from the rest, and will make it more unique.

When making features, you should make sure they are unique, and that they are fun to play. You should also make sure they are not too complicated, and that they are not too simple.
