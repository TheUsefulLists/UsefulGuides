## How much does it cost to run a server?

The cost of running a server depends on a lot of factors, including:
- How your hosting your server(s)
- Premium plugins (One time or recurring)
- Premium services
- How much you pay your staff
- How much you pay for advertising
- How much you pay for development
- How much you pay for graphics


## Saving money when getting started

When getting started, you should try to save as much money as possible. This will allow you to get started with a smaller budget, and will allow you to get started faster.

Here are some ways you can save money when getting started:
- Stick to free plugins
- Stick to free services
- Host your server yourself
- Find people willing to volunteer as staff while you get your server started out

### Free Plugins

There are lots of free plugins out there, and you should try to use as many as possible. This will allow you to save money, and will allow you to get started faster.
Most likely, whatever you want to do, there is a free plugin that can do it.

Here are some free plugins you can use:
- [EssentialsX](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/)
- [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/luckperms.28140/)
- [Vault](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/vault.34315/)
- [WorldGuard](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/worldguard.23458/)
- [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit-voxelsniper.13932/)

### Free Services

There are lots of free services out there, and you should try to use as many as possible. This will allow you to save money, and will allow you to get started faster.
Most likely, whatever you want to do, there is a free service that can do it.

No need to pay for a website starting out as it can wait till server development is done.

### Self Hosting

Self hosting is the cheapest way to host a server, but it is also the most complicated. You will need to set up everything yourself, and you will need to make sure you have enough bandwidth and storage.

If your the only one working on the server starting out it makes the most sense to self host. As it won't cost you anything and you can get started right away.

If you have a team of people working on the server (especially if they are paid) it makes more sense to use a hosting service. As it will be easier to manage and you won't have to worry about the server going down if your internet goes down.

If you are going to self host, you should make sure you have a good internet connection, and that you have enough bandwidth and storage. You should also make sure you have a good computer, and that you have enough ram.
