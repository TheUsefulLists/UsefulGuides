## Custom Game Modes

What is a custom game mode? A custom game mode is a game mode that your server/network has that is not found on other servers.
Why should you have a custom game mode? Having a custom game mode will make your server/network stand out from the rest, and will make it more unique.

When making a custom game mode, you should make sure it is unique, and that it is fun to play. You should also make sure it is not too complicated, and that it is not too simple.

## Overpowered Game Modes

Overpowered game modes are game modes that are not balanced. They are usually fun to play, but quickly become boring without lots of features to keep players interested.

As an example, a game mode where you can get a diamond pickaxe with efficiency 1000 and fortune 1000 is an overpowered game mode. It is fun to play, but quickly becomes boring. as you can tons of materials very quickly.

## Survival

Survival is a classic simple game mode.

With survival you won't have a lot of configurating to do, but you will need to make sure you have a good spawn, and a good set of rules.

You can add features to survival to make it more interesting and custom. Some examples of features you can add are:
- Custom mobs
- Custom items
- Custom enchants
- Custom crafting recipes
- Custom biomes
- Custom dimensions
- Custom structures
- Custom world generation
- level progression
- Custom bosses
- Custom events
- Custom quests
By no means is this a complete list, but it should give you some ideas.
